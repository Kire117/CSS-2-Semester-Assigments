    <div class="Lyrics">

            You leapt from crumbling bridges    <br>
            Watching cityscapes turn to dust    <br>

            <br>Filming helicopters crashing    <br>
            In the ocean from way above <br>

            <p class="Lyrics1"><br>Got the music in you, baby  <br>
                Tell me why <br>
                Got the music in you, baby  <br>
                Tell me why <br>
                You've been locked in here forever  <br>
                And you just can't say goodbye  <br>
            </p>

            <br>Kisses on the foreheads of the lovers   <br>
            Wrapped in your arms    <br>

            <br>You've been hiding them in hollowed out pianos  <br>
            Left in the dark    <br>

            <p class="Lyrics1"><br>Got the music in you, baby  <br>
                Tell me why <br>
                Got the music in you, baby  <br>
                Tell me why <br>    
                You've been locked in here forever  <br>
                And you just can't say goodbye  <br>
            </p>

            <p class="Lyrics2"><br>Your lips, my lips  <br>
                Apocalypse  <br>
            </p>

            <p class="Lyrics2"><br>Your lips, my lips  <br>
                Apocalypse  <br>
            </p>

            <br>Go and sneak us through the rivers  <br>
            Flood is rising up on your knees    <br>

            <br>Oh, please  <br>
            Come out and haunt me   <br>
            I know you want me  <br>
            Come out and haunt me   <br>

            <br>Sharing all your secrets with each other    <br>
            Since you were kids <br>

            <br>Sleeping soundly with the locket that she gave you  <br>    
            Clutched in your fist   <br>

            <p class="Lyrics1"><br>Got the music in you, baby  <br>
                Tell me     <br>
                Got the music in you, baby  <br>
                Tell me why <br>
                You've been locked in here forever  <br>
                And you just can't say goodbye  <br>
            </p>

            <br>You've been locked in here forever  <br>
            And you just can't say goodbye  <br>

            <p class="Lyrics2"><br>Ooh, oh <br>
                When you're all alone   <br>
                I'll reach for you  <br>
                When you're feelin' low <br>
                I'll be there too   <br></p>
